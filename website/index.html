						<h2>Summary</h2>
						<p>Zoom links are hard to use. There's no great Zoom built-in function to help you manage or organize them. 
							I built a calendar tab for Zoom's interface to allow for a time-based and intutive way for users to interact with their online schedules.
							<h2>Why Redesign?</h2>
							<p>My inspiration came from looking at Spotify's UI. I felt that it should be as easy to see your upcoming and recently visited 
								meetings as finding your liked songs on Spotify. Here were some problems I discovered during User Testing: </p>
								<h3><ul>
									<li>Difficult to store / organize Zoom links</li>
									<li>Incompatibility between Calendar apps (lack of native calendar in Zoom)</li>
									<li>Confusion in how meeting links are used</li>
								  </ul></h3>

							<i><p>Figure 1: Spotify's interface which lets you access recently visited songs.</p></i>
							<h2>Project Goals</h2>
							<h3>1. Build Zoom Calendar Tab</h3>
							<p>The lack of a native calendar for scheduling and viewing upcoming meetings in the Zoom app forces users to use 
								third party calendars, such as Google and Microsoft Calendars. For users who do not already use Google and Microsoft, 
								this is an inconvenience because they are <b>forced to choose a third party calendar </b>that is not already available with Zoom. 
								Users also may want to separate their Zoom calendars from their Google/Microsoft calendars, but are left with no choice but 
								to create a separate account to use their Microsoft/Google integrated calendars separately from their non-Zoom integrated calendars. 
								By having Zoom provide a native calendar, users can easily plan their meetings without having to use third party calendars. 
								The option to integrate third party calendars should still be available, but not forced upon the users. A native calendar 
								can also be a great feature to store, organize, and access their Zoom link meetings and provide a solution to the initial 
								issue mentioned earlier.
							</p>
							<h3>2. Learn and Understand UX/UI Design Proccess</h3>
							<p>I wanted to use different tools to aid in my development as a UX Designer. This was an important benchmark
								in my academic career, in which I moved beyond the classroom and brought my knowledge and experience
								to a real world setting. I'm excited to have the opportunity to show off what I have been working on.

						<h2> Data Science </h2>
						<p>The target audience is anyone who uses some form of video conferencing software regularly, which includes any 
							profession with reduced in-person communication due to the pandemic. To better understand how users feel about 
							the current Zoom interface and our proposed improvements, I conducted surveys and interviews to collect data.
							</p>
						<p>The ideal sample size would be at least thirty survey respondents. This will greatly aid in my
							 ability to conduct a statistical analysis and produce results I am confident in. Qualitative data will provide me with more open 
							 ended answers, opinions, and insights to better help us recognize trends and commonalities among users. I plan to use the master 
							 apperintence model, whereby  interviewees explain their observations to validate the reasoning behind my proposed solutions
							  and allow me to form a tenable hypothesis. Surveys, although not as detailed, will help 
							   extract quantitative data from a larger sample size in a shorter time frame. On the other hand, interviews are more time consuming, 
							   which restricts the sample size, but I will be able to collect high quality data since I can communicate with the users directly 
							   and ask open-ended questions.
						</p>

						<p><i>Figure 2: Example Survey sent to Users to Understand Sentiment about Zoom Calendars</i></p>
							<p>I decided to use Python and a Jupyter Notebook to clean/analyze the data. The code can be found at this 
								<a href='https://github.com/dzthai/cogs127/blob/main/Milestone2-Cogs127.ipynb'>Github Link</a>.</p>

						</i></p>

						<h4>Research Findings</h4>
						<p>About 83% of the sample users use Zoom regularly every week (3-20 hours). In addition, 100% of the people who took the 
							survey were college students. I would have preferred to reach a larger demographic age-wise, but due to time limitations, 
							I was only able to gather data amongst fellow students. For calendars used, there was a wide variety of answers. Surprisingly, 
							some people didn’t even use a calendar, and many others used varying calendars such as Canvas calendar, Apple calendar, Google calendar, 
							and Microsoft Outlook. In terms of the users’ experience using external calendars, the results were a bit ambiguous. 
							The mean was roughly a 3 from a likert scale of 1-5; users were neither extremely happy nor dissatisfied with their interfaces. 
							Moreover, 75% of users voted in favor of using a native Zoom calendar if it existed. Additionally, 10/18 of our users did not use calendars.
							 The remaining 8 of them did, and their average rating of the Zoom Calendar experience was a 2.875/5, which was higher than I expected.
